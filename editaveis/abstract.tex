\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
   This work is presenting the implementation of improvements and increased options for presenting search results in package repositories managers present in Linux distributions, in order to present the most relevant results to the user based on the input values, simplify the process search and address cases where entry has misspellings, whether through ignorance of the package name, either casual misspellings. Such implementation was built from string matching algorithms in the literature to expand the operation of the APT.
